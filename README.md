# Thomas Muat Portfolio
Code Institute Milestone Project - User-Centric Frontend Development

[Link to live site](tmuat.github.io/portfolio-site/)

This is a portfolio website used to showcase my coding through links to projects & repositories. This website informs potential employers a bit about myself, the projects I have worked on, my coding skills and a form with which to contact me on.

## UX

### Purpose

The main goal of this project was to create a site capable of showcasing my work with HTML & CSS to future employers, along with creating a site I can incorporate links to all my work. 

### User Stories

- As a visitor to the site:
    - Visit a clean, visually appealing site
    - Find links to any work the creator has made
    - Find an up to date CV
    - Be able to contact the portfolipo sites owner
    - A responsive site

## Features

### Existing Features

Aside from the normal aspects of a site, I utilised a bootstrap carousel, progress bar and snapped scrolling. The link to the tutorials for the aforementioned features can be found towards the bottom of this file.

### Features Left to Implement

As I complete more projects I would like to add these to the site. In the future, I would also like to add down arrows to each page which when clicked will scroll to the next page.


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Boostrap
- Javascript

## Testing

In order to check my codes were valid, the following validation services were used:
- HTML code was checked through [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
- CSS code was checked through [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)


## Deployment

This site was written using GitPod and is hosted on GitHub. The website has been deployed directly from the master branch of this repository with the link to the site at the top of this readme. To deploy the site I used the following steps:
- Ensured I was logged in to my GitHub before selecting the Tmuat/Portfolio-Site repository.
- Go to the settings tab along the repository navbar
- Scroll down to GitHub pages; ensure the source selected is 'Master Branch'
- Once done, the site should be deployed (note. this can take a few minutes)

If you would like to keep this repository in your local workspace, please follow the below instructions:
- Copy the following link into your editor... 'git clone https://github.com/Tmuat/Portfolio-Site.git' 

## Credits

### Content

- All content in the 'About Me' & 'My Work' sections from the website were written by the developer.

### Media

- #### Images
    - All images with the exception of the photo of myself in the 'About Me' page were taken from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/).
    - Some images were adapted using standard colour tools in Figma to ensure they were clearly visible beneath a colour overlay.
