# Thomas Muat Portfolio
Code Institute Milestone Project - User-Centric Frontend Development

[Link to live site](tmuat.github.io/portfolio-site/)

This is a portfolio website used to showcase my coding through links to projects & repositories. This website informs potential employers a bit about myself, the projects I have worked on, my coding skills and a form with which to contact me on.

## UX

### Purpose

The main goal of this project was to create a site capable of showcasing my work with HTML & CSS to future employers, along with creating a site I can incorporate links to all my work. 

### User Stories

- As a visitor to the site:
    - Visit a clean, visually appealing site
    - Find links to any work the creator has made
    - Find an up to date CV
    - Be able to contact the portfolipo sites owner
    - A responsive site

## Features

### Existing Features

Aside from the normal aspects of a site, I utilised a bootstrap carousel, progress bar and snapped scrolling. The link to the tutorials for the aforementioned features can be found towards the bottom of this file.

### Features Left to Implement

As I complete more projects I would like to add these to the site. In the future, I would also like to add down arrows to each page which when clicked will scroll to the next page.

- CSS

## Credits

### Content

- All content in the 'About Me' & 'My Work' sections from the website were written by the developer.

### Media

- #### Images
    - All images with the exception of the photo of myself in the 'About Me' page were taken from [Unsplash](https://www.unsplash.com/).
    - Some images were adapted using standard colour tools in Figma to ensure they were clearly visible beneath a colour overlay.
